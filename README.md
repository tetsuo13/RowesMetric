Analysis of Noticeability and Suspiciousness in Rowe's Exposure Metric
======================================================================

Video surveillance is an increasingly open problem in the security field where
we would like "suspicious" behavior to be distinguished. Using Rowe's exposure
metric, agents in a sensor field can be ranked for deceptiveness based on
several measurements. Noticeability and suspiciousness are two of the most
important metrics in measuring the exposure of a deceptive agent. Our research
analyses the effectiveness of these two metrics using statistical techniques
and simulated datasets. In this paper our results and findings will be
discussed in detail.
